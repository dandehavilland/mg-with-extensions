# mg-line-brushing

A extension to metrics-graphics which adds step-wise brushing support to line charts.

**Note:** the addon system is still under heavy development. This project will currently only work with [my pending PR](https://github.com/mozilla/metrics-graphics/pull/351) for metrics-graphics.
